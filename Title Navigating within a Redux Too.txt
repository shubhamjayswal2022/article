**Title: Navigating within a Redux Toolkit Action after AsyncThunk Fulfillment in React JS**

Have you ever wondered if it's possible to navigate to another screen within a Redux Toolkit action after an AsyncThunk operation has been successfully completed in a React JS application? In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to achieve this. 

**Step 1: Create a Navigation Module**

Start by creating a `navigation.ts` file at a global level and add the following code:

import * as React from "react";

export const navigationRef: React.RefObject<any> = React.createRef();

export default function navigate(name: any) {
  navigationRef.current(name);
}

In this step, we're setting up a global navigation reference using React's `createRef` and a `navigate` function to perform screen navigation.

**Step 2: Integrate Navigation in your App**

Next, you'll need to make changes to your `app.tsx` file:

import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import navigate, { navigationRef } from "./navigation";

function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    navigationRef.current = navigate;
  }, [navigate]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your routes container */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

In this step, we import the `navigate` function and connect it to your app using React Router's `useNavigate`. This allows you to update the navigation reference whenever it changes.

**Step 3: Implement Navigation in Redux Actions**

Now, you can use the `navigate` function within your Redux actions or services:

import { AxiosResponse } from "axios";
import axiosInstance from "./axiosInstance";
import navigate from "./navigation";

export const addJobDescription = async (data) => {
  try {
    const response: AxiosResponse = await axiosInstance.post(
      "/api/jobs/add",
      data
    );

    navigate("/verifyPage"); // Navigate to the desired screen
  } catch (error) {
    throw error?.response?.data?.message;
  }
};

In this final step, you import the `navigate` function and use it within your Redux action to navigate to the desired screen once your AsyncThunk operation has been successfully completed.

Congratulations, you've successfully integrated navigation within your Redux Toolkit action. This enables you to create more dynamic and interactive user experiences in your React JS application.
